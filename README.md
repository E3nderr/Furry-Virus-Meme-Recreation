# Furry-Virus-Meme-Recreation
Recreation of a popular meme gif

I coded this as a fun side project because a friend wanted me to code a working recreation of the "wypher furry virus" meme image.

This code does NOT harm your computer in any way, except maybe crashing python on weak hardware lol.
If you plan on *trying* to continue or use my shitty code, my condolences... Pwease gib credit tho owo

I tried building the python project into an exe-file but Tkinter seems to f*ck with cxfreeze and opens thousands
of instances of the app when running the resulting exe file.
If you figure out how to build the project into an exe somehow, congrats.
